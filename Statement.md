he Challenge (Problem):

Managing student academic data manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.
Teachers often need to record marks, calculate grades, search student records, and generate reports.
Doing all these tasks manually leads to:Difficulty in maintaining large student datasets , Mistakes in grade calculation , Slow searching and sorting processes , Lack of a systematic storage structure

Our Goal:
To design and develop a console-based Student Record Analyzer that automates student data management using core Python concepts.
The goal is to provide a lightweight, easy-to-use tool that helps users: Store student details systematically , Automatically calculate grades , Retrieve student information quickly , Sort data based on performance , Delete or update data when needed

What the Tool Does (Solution)

The Student Record Analyzer is a menu-driven Python application that solves the above challenge by providing the following features:

✔ Add a new student record (roll number, name, marks)

✔ Auto calculate grade based on entered marks

✔ Display all stored student records

✔ Search any student using their roll number

✔ Sort students by marks (highest to lowest)

✔ Delete a student record easily

✔ Exit safely
